# Environmental-Decision-Support-System
We have built a simple data-based Decision support system that diagnoses the importance of various parameters in influencing a solution to an environmental problem. 
Qualitative modelling approaches can be integrated and the solution can be improvised to have Knowledge-based features. 
Users of proposed system:
1. Students, Professors and educational institutions who want to research and understand how
actions and their consequences to the environmental parameters work
2. Policy makers who want to use the system to gain insights into how the policy should be
shaped to tackle an environmental problem.
3. Activists, media and information outlets who shall use the system to support projections
regarding concerned environmental data.
